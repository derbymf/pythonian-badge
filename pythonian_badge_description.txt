This program takes an empty list and populates it with a bunch of random numbers using a random list function:

def randomlist(templist):
    for i in range(10):
        x = random.randint(0,101)
        templist.append(x)
    return templist



The list is then written to a file that is either created or written to if it has already been created. When the list is written to a file it is written in strings so to do calculations with these numbers you have to convert them to ints:

randomNum = re.findall(r"[-+]?\d*\.\d+|\d+", infile)
randomNum  = list(map(int, randomNum))

To see if these numbers were ints I used various functions to do calculations on the list:

def Max(templist):
    Max = max(templist)
    return Max
def Min(templist):
    Min = min(templist)
    return Min
def Median(templist):
    Median = statistics.median(templist)
    return Median
def Average(templist):
    Average = statistics.mean(templist)
    return Average
def Std_Dev(templist):
    Std_Dev = statistics.stdev(templist)
    return Std_Dev

I then displayed them using pyplot and pumpy and followed a template to make the list a bar graph:

objects = ['Max', 'Min', 'Mean', 'Median', 'Standard Deviation']
height = np.arange(len(objects))
x_coord = [Max(randomNum), Min(randomNum), Average(randomNum), Median(randomNum),
Std_Dev(randomNum)]
plt.bar(height, x_coord, width = .8, color = ['blue
                                              '])
plt.ylabel('List of Random Numbers')
plt.xticks(height, objects)
plt.title('Numbers')
plt.show()
